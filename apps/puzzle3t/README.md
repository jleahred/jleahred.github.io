# Puzzle

A small web/client program to play with sliding puzzles

There are three kind of topologies

* Plain (classical)
* Cylindrical
* Toroidal


This is my second web program the first one is [(link)](http://jleahred.github.io/apps/hello_world/index.html)

My urls in github to see the code...  [link](http://jleahred.github.io), [link](https://github.com/jleahred/puzzle3t) and [link](https://github.com/jleahred) 


It has been developed with **Dart**



## Instructions

* Press [readme] to see/hide this file
* Press [setup] to access/hide configuration parameters
* Press [randomize] to mess the puzzle
* You can choose...

    * Image from server
    * Consecutive numbers
    * Color columns
    * Just two colors

### Difficulty

To train and learn how to solve, you can start with 2 Colors, and continue with colors.

Obviously, reducing the number of pieces will also reduce the complexity. 



## Topologies

* **Plain** topology is the classic sliding puzzle game
* **Cylinder**, is a cylindric puzzle. You can move rows rotating them on the cylinder.
You can also move vertically pieces to the hole.
* **Toroidal** topology doesn't require a hole. You can move the whole row or column. Just try it, it's fun  


## Moving

### Plain

* Click on piece to move

### Cylindrical

* In order to move a row, press mouse button and move the piece horizontally to new position
* In order to move vertically a piece to the hole, just click on this piece

## Toroidal

* Easy, just move the piece to the new position with left button pressed
