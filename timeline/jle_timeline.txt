- ### ![](images/book-stack-32.png) Small, safe, self contained, soft realtime C++ toolkit
- I wrote and collected tools previously, but now, I'm going to rewrite the ideas from scratch
in order to use C++11 and C++14 (and even C++17) and remove the tools added on these new C++ versions
[(src)](https://github.com/jleahred/jle_cpp_tk) [(doc)](../jle_cpp_tk.doc/index.html)



- ### now
2011
- ### ![](images/ic_account_balance_24px.svg) Grupo CIMD
- I started with:

Financial markets and FIX connections real-time and distributed platform designer
(back and front), developer and responsible.

Developer and maintaner of safe, real-time, multiplatform C++ library used in
backend and frontend applications

Techs: C++, gcc, Qpid, Firebird, MySQL, Qt, git, pmwiki

And... *continues*


- ### 2015
- ### ![](images/book-stack-32.png) Dart, Polymer and Web SPA development
- I investigated Dart and Single Page Application development
and creating Polymer components

This page is my first Polymer component [src](https://github.com/jleahred/timeline)


- ### 2014-10
- ### ![](images/talk-32.png) Elixir talk
- I spoke about Elixir programming language in Madrid Erlunge to some Erlang enthusiast.

It was a great experience. [link](http://jleahred.github.io/talks/elixir-2014-10.html)

- ### 2014
2010
- ### ![](images/book-stack-32.png) Elixir, Rust, Go, Nimrod, CouchDB, Redis, Riak
- Elixir got my heart with his methaprogramming features combined with Erlang concurrency,
fault tolerance and concepts

For a C++ programmer is mandatory to know Rust and Go (even D, Nimrod and Vala).
They are new programming languages trying to add value to our veteran C++.
In fact, they are very interesting languages and options (concurrency with message
passing is not a fashion is the right way)

NoSQL databases, with auto-sharding, non ACID, performance...



- ### 2011
- ### ![learning](images/book-stack-32.png) safe C++ portable and soft real time library
- A C++ library, portable (win linux), soft real-time, low dependencies, safe oriented with...

Support: static signal slot, safe smart pointers, config files (ini and nested cfgs), tuples,
date time monotonic with microadjustemnts, LL(n) parser, external DSL for finite state machines,
stl wrapper to avoid crashes with invalid iterators, factory repositories templates, double safe
comparison, real time control and monitoring...

Communication: Qpid wrapper, external DSL for qpid types message parsing (recursive auto descriptive)
and YAML persistence

Monitoring: real time monitoring, qt client monitor

It was used and I continue the development working in Grupo CIMD

- ### 2005
2002

- ### ![job](images/book-stack-32.png) Scala, Nemerle, Boo, Python...
- I started following Scala before version 1.0. Fantastic language

I also loved Nermerle. Impressive metaprogramming features.

I did some report tools with Boo on .net. Very interesting.

I started to do small things with Python



- ### 2002
2001

- ### ![job](images/ic_account_balance_24px.svg) Ahorro Corporación, Analyst and programmer
- Creation of a terminal and engines for automatic orders connected to some electronic markets


- ### 2002
2000
- ### ![learning](images/book-stack-32.png) Haskell, Erlang, LISP and declarative programming
- I studied Haskell. It was amazing.
The feeling was similar to first time I learned programming

Erlang was a fantastic discovery. Again a different way to think. **The world is concurrent** and less
OOP with inheritance. Fault tolerant systems with **let it crash**


- ### 2001
1995
- ### ![learning](images/book-stack-32.png) System computers science UNED
- Studing at (non presencial) university while working at Gesmosa-GBI

I got the highest mark with honors in "develop, administration and configuration of computer systems". It was about
software development methodologies and metrics. No word at this time about *agile*. When I have to apply all this staff (been team
leader and product manager), I was thinking about all these lectures... and I decided to do something different (with
a great result). Some years later, I discover it was *agile philosophy*

I was cheated about concurrency. Some time later I learned that semaphores, critical sections and similar
with shared memory was not a good solution. The good solution is share nothing and pass messages (like erlang, a
actors, CSP...)

On databases was no so bad. The book said... we can normalize to 5th normal form, but it was not practical to go
beyond 3NF or the special case BCNF (Boyce Codd)

But now, I also appreciate the non relational databases (specially document and key-value ones) for some kind of
models or even to deal with CAP theorem

ADA and it rendezvous was an amazing discovery. I liked it quite more than Java.


- ### ­2001
2000
- ### ![learning](images/book-stack-32.png) Databases servers
- I studied Interbase, later firebird, MySql, postgresql, sybase and ms-sqlserver. I also tried with Oracle but it was not an option.

I read features, and comparison with all databases. I loved MVCC in wich Firebird grand father (Groton database) was pioneer.

Firebird was very simple to install in Linux and windows, it could work as server or embedded, very powerful, great concurrency control...



- ### ­2001
1994

- ### ![job](images/ic_account_balance_24px.svg) Programmer and IT assistant at Gesmosa­GBI
- Developing some financial calculation libraries and applications

Database applications, general IT support in Gesmosa and link between business and IT

I did my first and last visual basic program.

I also programmed financial calculations in Delphi to be used from Excel.

And I continued with Borland Builder C++ doing realtime calculations, support applications, financial libraries...



- ### 1994
1992
- ### ![learning](images/book-stack-32.png) Initiated physics
- I met Richard Feynman, and I loved his lectures (amazing)

- ### 1993
1988
- ### ![learning](images/book-stack-32.png) I bought my first computer
- It was a second hand 286 computer

With it I calculated 2^44497-1, it was the biggest prime number at that time (13.395 digits)

I also learned DOS, DbaseIII+, Clipper summer 87, Turbo basic and... C, even a bit of C++

An extremely amazing moment was programing in C my own rational numbers library. I discovered my self an extremely efficient
way to calculate greatest common divisor. I suspected that someone did it before, I estimated it woud be arround 2000 years ago.
I was absolutely right


- ### ­1992
- ![](images/cannon-24.png) Military service
- Mandatory and far, far away from home

I played a couple of chess matches winning both


- ### ­1992
1988

- ![job](images/ic_account_balance_24px.svg) Canary island's bank
- Working in administrative tasks


- ### ­1982
1985
- ![job](images/book-stack-32.png) Started programming
- First my Uncle and his computer.
He showed me the first program. It was basic and it calculated multiplication table.
To me was complex to understand the destructive assignment.

Some days, some weeks on summer, I used his computer (Commodore 64) and I started to program.
First basic, later 6502/6510 assembler

I had a friend with a spectrum and I used to go to his house to do *Extreme programming* ;-P with him
