Hi, I'm José Luis.

I've been working on software development for several years.

As you can see, I'm not a web designer, in fact, I'm not a graphical designer of any kind.

I've been working in algorithms and backend software with several technologies.

You can see more details in my C.V. bellow

I love learning and technologies. You can see it in my blog (also bellow)

Let me show you some links related with me (blog, cv, programs...)

## How this page was done...

Previosly, I had a _google site_ [(link)](https://sites.google.com/site/joseluisestebanaparicio/home). It was a kind 
of _wyiswyg_ editor to prepare a **html**. Well, this is not very funny.
Even more important, it's not flexible neither practical (specially for someone with programming knolegment). Behind _wyiswyg_
there are a lot of pain and problems (even for not programming guys).

Therefore, I prepared this little page to replace the boring one (obiosly, 100% free of _wysiwyg_).

When you load this page in your browser, a minimum **html** file is rendered. It calls a **Dart** program compiled 
in **javascript**. 

This miniprogram, will request for a text file, **markdown** formated, to the server. It will also 
compile (the js code running on client) the **markdown** generating **html** content and it will insert it in **DOM**. 

When I need to add or modif content on this page, I can do it in a simple **markdown** file. Avoiding the unpleasant 
direct **html** codes.

Yes, in order to prepare it, I had to deal with a bit of **html** and a small **css**.
