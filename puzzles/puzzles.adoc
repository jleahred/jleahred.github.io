= Physical puzzles

Here there are some of my physical puzzles that I had fun solving them.

The list is (more or less) in chronological order, but at the moment without dates (I could add it in a future)

This kind was the first one (it was with a Sherlock Homes picture)...

The first option is plain, second barrel and third (it's an original one) is a toroidal puzzle.

I wrote this game several years ago with Delphi language.

On the link, you can see a client web program written on Dart as a practice on this language and technology
